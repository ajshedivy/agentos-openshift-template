### Architecture Overview

The IBM i Agent Infrastructure is built around the **MCP Server as the central component**, providing all agents with unified access to IBM i system data and services.

**Key Components:**

- **Agent UI**: Web-based chat interface for interacting with specialized agents
- **IBM i Agents**: Four specialized agents (Performance, Discovery, Browse, Search) that orchestrate IBM i operations
- **MCP Server** ⭐: Central tool provider enabling agents to query IBM i databases and system services via standardized protocol
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage for agent sessions, memory, and conversation history
- **AI Models**: Multi-provider LLM support (watsonx, OpenAI, Anthropic) for agent intelligence
- **IBM i System**: Production IBM i environment with Db2 database

**How It Works:**

1. Users interact with agents through the web UI
2. Agents leverage the **MCP Server** to access IBM i data via tool calls
3. MCP Server executes SQL queries and retrieves system information
4. Agents use AI models for reasoning and natural language understanding
5. All interactions are persisted in PostgreSQL for continuity


## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running or Podman
- API key from **at least one** AI provider:
  - [watsonx API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/) (IBM Cloud) **OR**
  - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) **OR**
  - [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com)

> **Note**: The IBM i MCP server runs automatically as part of the Docker Compose stack - no separate setup required!

## Quick Start

Get the IBM i Agent Infrastructure running in 3 steps:

### 1. Configure API Keys

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd app
```
Create `infra/.env` with your API keys (choose at least one provider):
```bash
# AI Model Provider (Choose at least one)
# Anthropic - Get from console.anthropic.com (default model)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-your_anthropic_key

# watsonx (IBM Cloud) - Get from cloud.ibm.com
WATSONX_API_KEY=your_ibm_cloud_api_key
WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# OpenAI - Get from platform.openai.com/api-keys

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

Run the `dev_setup.sh` script. This will create a virtual environment and install project dependencies:

```sh
./scripts/dev_setup.sh
```

### Activate Virtual Environment

Activate the created virtual environment:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

(On Windows, the command might differ, e.g., `.venv\Scripts\activate`)

## Managing Python Dependencies

If you need to add or update python dependencies:

### Modify pyproject.toml

Add or update your desired Python package dependencies in the `[dependencies]` section of the `pyproject.toml` file.

### Generate requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` file is used to build the application image. After modifying `pyproject.toml`, regenerate `requirements.txt` using:

```sh
./scripts/generate_requirements.sh
```

To upgrade all existing dependencies to their latest compatible versions, run:

```sh
./scripts/generate_requirements.sh upgrade
```

### Rebuild Docker Images

Rebuild your Docker images to include the updated dependencies:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Running Tests

This project comes with a set of integration tests that you can use to ensure the application is working as expected.

First, start the application:

## Running in Production

This repository includes a `Dockerfile` for building a production-ready container image of the application.

The general process to run in production is:

1. Update the `scripts/build_image.sh` file and set your IMAGE_NAME and IMAGE_TAG variables.
2. Build and push the image to your container registry:

```sh
./scripts/build_image.sh
```

3. Run in your cloud provider of choice.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Configure for Production**

- Ensure your production environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, database connection strings) are securely managed. Most cloud providers offer a way to set these as environment variables for your deployed service.
- Review the agent configurations in the `/agents` directory and ensure they are set up for your production needs (e.g., correct model versions, any production-specific settings).

2. **Build Your Production Docker Image**

- Update the `scripts/build_image.sh` script to set your desired `IMAGE_NAME` and `IMAGE_TAG` (e.g., `your-repo/agent-api:v1.0.0`).
- Run the script to build and push the image:

  ```sh
  ./scripts/build_image.sh
  ```

3. **Deploy to a Cloud Service**
   With your image in a registry, you can deploy it to various cloud services that support containerized applications. Some common options include:

- **Serverless Container Platforms**:

  - **Google Cloud Run**: A fully managed platform that automatically scales your stateless containers. Ideal for HTTP-driven applications.
  - **AWS App Runner**: Similar to Cloud Run, AWS App Runner makes it easy to deploy containerized web applications and APIs at scale.
  - **Azure Container Apps**: Build and deploy modern apps and microservices using serverless containers.

- **Container Orchestration Services**:

  - **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: A highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. Often used with AWS Fargate for serverless compute or EC2 instances for more control.
  - **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: A managed Kubernetes service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Google infrastructure.
  - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: A managed Kubernetes service for deploying and managing containerized applications in Azure.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS) with Docker Support**

  - **Railway.app**: Offers a simple way to deploy applications from a Dockerfile. It handles infrastructure, scaling, and networking.
  - **Render**: Another platform that simplifies deploying Docker containers, databases, and static sites.
  - **Heroku**: While traditionally known for buildpacks, Heroku also supports deploying Docker containers.

- **Specialized Platforms**:
  - **Modal**: A platform designed for running Python code (including web servers like FastAPI) in the cloud, often with a focus on batch jobs, scheduled functions, and model inference, but can also serve web endpoints.

The specific deployment steps will vary depending on the chosen provider. Generally, you'll point the service to your container image in the registry and configure aspects like port mapping (the application runs on port 8000 by default inside the container), environment variables, scaling parameters, and any necessary database connections.

4. **Database Configuration**

- The default `docker-compose.yml` sets up a PostgreSQL database for local development. In production, you will typically use a managed database service provided by your cloud provider (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) for better reliability, scalability, and manageability.
- Ensure your deployed application is configured with the correct database connection URL for your production database instance. This is usually set via an environment variables.
